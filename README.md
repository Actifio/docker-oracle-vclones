# Mounting Oracle Databases with Docker

This repository provides necessary codes and instructions to create Docker containers with Oracle databases mounted via Actifio. 

*NOTE:* This is a experimental approach and not a direct feature of the product nor a qualified product methodology.

# Where to start?

You can start by cloning this git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Actifio/docker-oracle-vclones.git
```

# Pre-requisites

Steps described in this document provides instructions on how to create a Docker Image capable of creating Virtual DB Clones of Oracle databases. However these instructions would expect an existing Docker Image which contains Oracle binaries, or rather container image with Oracle Software installed.

In these examples, I've used an image based on Centos:7 with Oracle Installed. I will link details on how to create such an image at a later stage. 

If you search the Docker Hub, there are several project / images around these images, and Oracle stock image (https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition?tab=description) might be a good place to start.


# Building the image

From the cloned repository, modify the ```Dockerfile``` to suite your base image. 

```
FROM oracle11204
```

should be changed to 

```
FROM yourimagerepo/oracleimage
```

Inside the git repository, run:

```

# Start the container

Starting the container is little more complicated than the steps we followed sofar. Docker Container need to be told where to find the Oracle database to be mounted in to the container. These details need to be passed as environment variable from the CLI:

```
-e ACT_APPLIANCE=mysky \
-e ACT_USER=demo \
-e ACT_PASS=demo \
-e ACT_APPNAME=hugedb \
-e ACT_SRCHOST=oraserver \
-e ORACLE_SID=mycopy \
-e ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/app/product/11204/ora_1 \
```

| Envar | Description
|---|---|
| ACT_APPLIANCE | Applaince IP or the host name
| ACT_USER | Actifio user account name, with the Mount Manage privileges
| ACT_PASS | Actifio user password 
| ACT_APPNAME | Actifio Application name, or the name of the Database as it appears in Actifio
| ACT_SRCHOST | Hostname where this database is preotected from
| ORACLE_SID | New Oracle SID to create the virtual clone
| ORACLE_HOME | Oracle Home, as per the Docker Image
| ORACLE_USER | Oracle User, defaults to "oracle" if not specified

## Other requirements

Actifio connector is not qualified to run inside containers and in this case, we're not relying on Containers to communicate with Actifio appliance via a connector. However we're going to use the resources from Actifio connector from the host inside the container. Therefore we would need to bind mount ```/act``` from Docker host to the container. 

For this bind mount we require bind-propagation set to ```shared```. This must be explicitly mentioned, and the default option would not allow mounting Actifio Volumes to the containers.

If you wish to access the database from an external application, you will required to map the port ```1521``` during the container creation.

## Example:

```
$ docker container run -d -e ACT_APPLIANCE=mysky \
-e ACT_USER=demo \
-e ACT_PASS=demo \
-e ACT_APPNAME=hugedb \
-e ACT_SRCHOST=oraserver \
-e ORACLE_SID=mycopy \
-e ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/app/product/11204/ora_1 \
--name my-oracle \
--mount type=bind,source=/act,target=/act,bind-propagation=shared \
--port 1521:1521 \
ora-actifio 
```

Once started you should be able to list the following way:

```
[root@kubebossman docker-oracle-vclones]# docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
b53667e390d4        ora-actifio            "/bin/sh -c 'python â€¦"   7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes                            my-oracle
```
